# Rana Mod

## About
This mod brings back the cutest girl from the [Indev](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Java_Edition_removed_features#Beast_Boy.2C_Black_Steve.2C_Steve.2C_and_Rana).
 
I was inspired by [KodaichiZero's Rana Mod](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/1272375-1-7-3-rana-mod-v7). I tried to recreate the model but with fewer polygons.
